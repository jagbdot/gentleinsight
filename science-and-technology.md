					<p><b>2018, Amsterdam, Netherlands.</b> Book cover design directed to readers ages 9 to 12 in order to dive into the life of Leonardo Da Vinci and his inventions, art, observations, and experiments that were either performed or inspired by him. The illustration could either focus on his accomplishments or his image.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The main work here was to make a collage of images related to the subject. I took the main invention as the helicopter (drawn in 1493, 450 years earlier than an actual helicopter would take to the air). The idea was to portray the golden era of the renaissance and so the design had to convey this in some graphic sense. The mystery and knowledge were also important factors to go for. I began using one of his drawings and gave up on that idea.</p>
					<p>To make the context more personal the background of the sky night includes Da Vinci’s calligraphy taken from his notes and observations. The process was very quickly</p>
