					<p><b>2010, Antwerp, Belgium.</b> 3 digital paintings. Learning about brushes and techniques in the procreate app. I wanted some references and do different things. The first portrait is using a friend’s picture. Here i wanted to go for the realistic outlook and challenge myself to see certain level of result without using more than 2 brushes on different size and opacity.</p>
					<p><b>The second idea was more conceptual.</b> I took a picture of Stanley Kubrick to portray a scene from the movie Clockwork orange. The portrait was meant to be part of a scene where the main character has different objects around identifying his personality on the film. One of the goals was to reverse the roles of the director and character, so Kubrick would be inside the screen, and Alex (the character) would be sitting (on the director’s chair) and watching the movie. The clothing, the TV, a glass of milk and the snake were some of the clues, and the head of Alex is replaced by an orange.</p>
					<p>The third idea was based on a picture of the Billie Holiday.  I wanted to draw this character with a big head to emphasize the idea of a “portrait”, and give it a bit of context. As the picture of holiday only shows the face, i took a second picture from the singer Nina Simone and took it as a reference to draw the body and the piano. in general, the music of Holiday has a melancholic mood, so i chose colder colors for the painting process.</p>
