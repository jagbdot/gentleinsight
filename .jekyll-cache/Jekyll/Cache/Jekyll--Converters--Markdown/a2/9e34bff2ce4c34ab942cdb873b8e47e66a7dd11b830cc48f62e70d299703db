					<p><b>2019, Antwerpen, Belgium.</b> Heft is a new <a href="https://www.heft.be/en/">cocktail bar</a> located in <i>Jordaenskaai #27</i>. They focus on giving value to their craft, experimenting and coming up with interesting drinks. The place exhales a comfortable feeling, with a rustic and sophisticated look and feel. They started with a set of creative drinks on their menu, but the problem was that reading the name / description was not enough to get attracted and try them out. Also, each cocktail comes in a different glass, therefore, it became important to bring the details upfront.</p>
					<p><b>The first idea was to portray every cocktail</b> on a double-paged format on the menu. So you can see the cocktail on one side (color, amount, garnish..) and the type of glass on the other (plus ingredients involved in the process of making it). <i>The brain is recording at any place it goes</i>; if you came out of the bar with a clear image of the menu, you're more likely to come back or, at least, spread the word about it. All of us can recall an aspect from the places we've been to. It can be one, it can be many, but even the smallest detail can be an emotional trigger on the memory.</p>
					<p><b>The work was done in the Procreate app.</b> The new year was coming and it was a moment to promote the party with some illustrations. A distinctive aspect from this bar it's the angle from the windows, showing a good perspective from the Schelde river, and this gave an opportunity to take advantage from the outlook.</p>
