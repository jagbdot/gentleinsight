					<p>Feedonate was a project developed in the Ironhack Bootcamp at the beginnings of 2016 in Madrid. Food waste has been always a subject that concernes people around the world. This was a quick prototype to offer one of many solutions.</p>

					<p><b>2016, Madrid, Spain.</b> Feedonate is born as an approach to get rid of the food waste in the country. A way to connect food banks with donations from companies and supermarkets where food needs to be within certain parameters standardized by the market. So whatever does not apply can be offered as a donation. According to a report by the <i>Spanish Ministry of Agriculture</i>,¬†<i>food¬†and the Environment</i>, approximately <b>8 million tons of food are wasted in Spain each year</b>. Many¬†stores are now committed to doing better, but¬†grocery¬†store¬†food waste¬†is still a massive problem.</p>
					<p><b>The idea was to develop an app where you can register as a donor / food bank.</b> Depending on which type of user is registered, you‚Äôre able to look for donations or make one as a list (basket), categorizing the type of food and the amounts available. Once you ask for a donation, the companies need to accept the request if the conditions are in order. Donors could also reach for food banks that are looking for supplies. To foment the companies to keep on track with the app, each one would be ranked to see how many donations they‚Äôve done and make it visible to the public. So the altruistic action would be celebrated in a way to persuade people to buy from those companies instead of the regular ones.</p>
					<p><b>The logotype was designed combining the ideas of feeding (‚Äúmouth‚Äù) and receiving (‚Äúopen arms‚Äù).</b> The packaging was intended for non-perishable food. The intention was to show a clean design and make it appealing for each sides in question.</p>
					<p>The app was prototyped and developed with <i>Ruby on Rails</i>, <i>Postgress</i> for Database, <i>Devise</i> for user registration / login and <i>Heroku</i> for deployment, all in a time-frame of 1 week.</p>
