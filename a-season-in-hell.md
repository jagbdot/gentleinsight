					<p><b>2018, Amsterdam, Netherlands.</b> A season in hell was published in 1873, by French writer Arthur Rimbaud. It is the only work that was published by himself, after abandoned the life of excessiveness with his partner; Paul Verlaine. Referencing this project is the life of the artist, alluding to an emotional state of mind but no private from a ludic perspective.</p>
					<p><b>The initial thought</b> was to portray the atmosphere. The exaggerated image of the writer on his desk and ready to work. His hands came into mind. Dismal hands, fingers running through papers. I saw the psyche of an artist going around in circles, looking for the words and the ultimate meaning. Along this lines of imagination, there were no longer hands, but two spiders! Once that was figured, the concept was ready to be displayed on the whole editorial piece.</p>
					<p><b>Later in the process,</b> the idea of contrasting his early life and after (going to Africa to make money), was shown as two pictures on the author side of the book. Illustration and editing were done in Photoshop. From this project i've learned how with one simple concept is possible to approach every aspect that needs to be designed.</p>
